# FreelanceDesk📝📝

FreelanceDesk is a multi-user platform designed for freelancers to efficiently manage clients, projects, and follow-ups in one place. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) & N8N for automation, it leverages a headless architecture, where the backend and frontend are decoupled and communicate via REST APIs.

This approach ensures scalability, flexibility, and seamless integration with third-party services. Freelancers can securely manage multiple clients simultaneously without any data leakage, making collaboration simple and reliable.
